## Haunt Furnace ##

Haunt Furnace is a furnace that haunts your items and transforms them into something new.

By haunting, you can convert cobblestone into blackstone, mushrooms into nether mushrooms, infest stone, turn dirt or sand into soul soil or soul sand, convert campfires, torches, or lanterns into their soul variants, and even make things glow.

There are currently over 30 haunting recipes. New recipes can easily be added through a datapack. The "hauntfurnace:haunting" recipe type should have the same format as any standard "smelting" recipe.

Inspired by the Create mod. This is a furnace variant of the "Bulk Haunting" recipes from Create.

The haunt furnace is a standalone mod. It has all of the same recipes as Create, and adds a bunch more. If the Create mod is installed, the new recipes will be available as bulk haunting recipes.

Has support for Croptopia, Farmer's Delight, Charm, More Berries, and Create.

REI, JEI, and EMI are supported.
