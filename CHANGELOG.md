## Haunt Furnace v0.5.0

* Updated to Minecraft 1.21.5
* Added support for recipe book categories
* Added new furnaces: Ender Furnace and Powered Ender Furnace to "corrupt" items into items from the end. Inspired by Create: Halitosis
* The powered furnaces are now abstract furnaces, and should have more automatic compatibility with mods that do things with furnaces (Jade, for example).
* Jade will now display cooking process in a Powered Haunt or Ender Furnace the same way it would for any other furnace.
